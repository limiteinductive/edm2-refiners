# edm2-refiners

The goal of this repository is to provide an implementation of the ADM diffusion model (config G) and provide a way to train it using the [Refiners](https://github.com/finegrain-ai/refiners) framework.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement the ADM model
- [ ] Implement the training loop
- [ ] Train a Dino-conditioned version of the model
- [ ] Train an LLM-conditioned version of the model
